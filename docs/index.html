            I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Center for Robotics and Biosystems (CRB) at Northwestern University, advised by Dr. Michael Rubenstein, who holds joint appointments in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. My research focuses on full-stack robot design, particularly in swarm and modular robotic systems, with an emphasis on sensing and control for multi-agent coordination. I bring experience in algorithm development and system design from my time in the aerospace industry at Northrop Grumman, as well as from my undergraduate training in engineering.

              <p>
                The automated battery swapping and charging (ABSAC) project centers on building a fully automated battery swapping and charging system for drone swarms. I designed and fabricated a functional prototype, including modular components such as magnetized charging mounts and later spring-fit charging mounts and a forklift-style end-effector that also spring-fits onto batteries for carrying and placing. The control software—migrated from MicroPython to C—enables precise navigation and alignment during swapping operations has versions for both Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32 (via PlatformIO) microcontrollers. The system has completed over 2,500 successful battery exchanges with no critical errors and is designed to manage up to 100 batteries continuously, performing a swap every 30 seconds. Supervised undergraduate research.

                This project focuses on developing reconfigurable swarm robots capable of collective self-organization. I built a full-stack simulation framework for one-degree-of-freedom robots using differential programming, modeling real-world effects like magnetism and friction. Starting in Unity and later transitioning to DiffTaichi, I designed algorithms for shape identification, formation control, and lattice organization. To accelerate experimentation, I created headless simulations and gradient-descent optimization routines. I also contributed to hardware design—covering sensing, communication, and charging.
