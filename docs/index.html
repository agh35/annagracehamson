            I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Center for Robotics and Biosystems (CRB) at Northwestern University, advised by Dr. Michael Rubenstein, who holds joint appointments in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. My research focuses on full-stack robot design, particularly in swarm and modular robotic systems, with an emphasis on sensing and control for multi-agent coordination. I bring experience in algorithm development and system design from my time in the aerospace industry at Northrop Grumman, as well as from my undergraduate training in engineering.
